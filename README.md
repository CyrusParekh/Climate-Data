# Climate-Data
Introduction: The purpose of this report is to identify a trend in climate data using spectral analysis and forecast that trend into the future. The trend that will be explored and forecasted in this report is the annual number of days the Arctic Ocean remains frozen.

Data: This data comes from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). The ECMWF collects worldwide climate data including information on the seven ocean basins. This report uses a small subsection from their most recent ERA5 report containing the time, coordinates, sea surface temperature, wave height, and windspeed data for the Arctic Ocean spanning the past eight decades(1940-2024). For more details and to reference worldwide data for all seven oceans their website can be found here: Copernicus Climate Data Store. 

Data Preparation Steps
1. Removing outliers
2. Calculating the number of days the ocean is frozen each year
3. Appending new information to the original dataset for continuity
4. Creating a new dataset containing the year and number of days the ocean was frozen.
